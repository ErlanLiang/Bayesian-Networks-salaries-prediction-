    Execute the variable elimination algorithm on the Bayesian network bayes_net

    evidence provided by EvidenceVars. 

    :param bayes_net: a BN object.
    :param var_query: the query variable. we want to compute a distribution
                     over the values of the query variable.
    :param EvidenceVars: the evidence variables. Each evidence variable has 
                         its evidence set to a value from its domain 
                         using set_evidence.
    :return: a Factor object representing a distribution over the values
             of var_query. that is a list of numbers, one for every value
             in var_query's domain. These numbers sum to 1. The i-th number
             is the probability that var_query is equal to its i-th value given 
             the settings of the evidence variables.

    For example, assume that
        var_query = A with Dom[A] = ['a', 'b', 'c'], 
        EvidenceVars = [B, C], and 
        we have called B.set_evidence(1) and C.set_evidence('c'), 
    then VE would return a list of three numbers, e.g. [0.5, 0.24, 0.26]. 
    These numbers would mean that 
        Pr(A='a'|B=1, C='c') = 0.5, 
        Pr(A='a'|B=1, C='c') = 0.24, and 
        Pr(A='a'|B=1, C='c') = 0.26.
